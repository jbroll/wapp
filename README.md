#### static
 This adds the ability to serve static content using fcopy without reading
 the entire file into memory first.  This might undermine some of the
 deliberate security of wapp, but some care was taken.  Feedback regarding
 security welcome.

#### routes
 Boiler plate generator for unpacking route path values and wapp-params into
 local variables in a page handler.

#### From [lego12239/wapp](https://github.com/lego12239/wapp)

This is a fork of original wapp from D. Richard Hipp with some changes:

- support of PUT, PATCH, DELETE http methods;
- fix cookies parsing(make parsing more rfc6265 compliant,
  but be more liberal to cookie value,
  allowing any chars except dquote in a quoted value and
  any char except semicolon in a nonquoted value);
- throw error on bad cookie value set;
- -server option accepts a listen address in plan9 format:
  tcp!ADDR!PORT or tcp!ADDR!0 or tcp!ADDR or ADDR.
  If PORT isn't specified or 0, then the first not used port is selected.
  If ADDR is 0.0.0.0, then listen on wildcard address;
- fix request target parsing(make parsing more rfc3986 compliant);
- fix request header name-value parsing(make parsing more rfc7230 compliant);
